BUGS
Not working with MVOE_ event files 2023,4,5
after obspy update, crashes with call to 
	thisFig.set_size_inches(plotSize2[0]/100.0, plotSize2[1]/100.0)
	line 842
sometimes mismatch of length of t and d when I try to plot Z spectrums
check if 3C plots are normalized
SUDDENLY FILE NAMES HAVE SECONDS BY DEFAULT - then not
noflag time doesn't work unless at end
green line doesn't seem to be plotted in right place, see 20230420-1545--Distal_VT-MBLG-3C-5s2.png
strain works, but not sure if it can cope with MC seismic channels at same time
fmax for tfr doesn't plot
use mseed for default if wws not working
use plotaday code for faulty mseed files
multi-day from mseed files
--plotfile doesn't set tag
--plotfile doesn't work properly with -- in filename
cont might not get all data before arrival
set ylim works for multi-channel plots?

REVIEW tests
why did testPlots stop after 15?

ADD
default pre 1/6 of dur
add number of poles for filter
change to only fetching data required
add xxxxxlong
move statons grouping from --kind to --sta
default pre as fixed percentage of dur
TICK    option of file names ending in bz2
On 3C plots, make Y + and - scales the same
default file directory
use mseed if up to n days ago
simple datetime 20230929-1212
non-MVO stations
xxx spectrum plot
3CPM option
--noshow option to override --show (include this in fe)
add HDF
add channel flag
add kind to show original with filtered
add max and min to rms output

despiking
setting different z limits when big events are present = Normalize sgram in only a narrow f range
timescale in minutes or hours as well as seconds, also filename changes
output max amp of envelope to file, append
set times if reading from file
particle motions

scaleogram - remove values outside fmin fmax range
why two tick scales on lahar plot?
filter before trim
spectrogram option for normalising individual spectrums
create cutoff date for wavserver requests - to get all channsl! -- not needed, they all have 
lahar plot needs f scale
add grayscale option to spectrograms
get strain data MC.*..BHL 

get MSS1 with close?

restore rockfall plot in library

see if getnPlotRockfall is quikcer otr not with local mseed file.

normalise is messed up
